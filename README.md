# Alleghany-County-Parcel-Elevation
My goal for creating this web map was to be able to see which parcels in Alleghany County, NC have the steepest elevation, and contrarily the lowest elevation. The entire county is basically a mixture of foothills and small mountains, making for an interesting topographical area to study. Creating the map was difficult, as my shapefile sizes for both variables of contour lines and parcels were rather large. The data source shapefiles I got for this lab came from NC One Map for my Alleghany Parcels, and from the Blue Ridge Conservancy for my contour data. Some of the major functions and pathways I used were from CartoDb in order to establish my basemap, I centered the map and edited contour line opacity and shade, as well as for the parcels in Alleghany County. The result I came to find was that towards the center of the county, near the capital of Sparta, there is less elevation change in those parcels, while in the southern and western parts of the county there is more mountainous and steep landscape.
